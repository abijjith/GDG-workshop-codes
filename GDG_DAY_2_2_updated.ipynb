This means the baby develops inside an egg, and the mother lays it on land or in water. The baby then hatches from the egg when it's ready.\\n\\n**Some animals**, like insects, don't give birth or lay eggs. Instead, they go through a process called metamorphosis, where they change from one form to another. \\n\\nIt's amazing how different animals have different ways of bringing new life into the world! \\n\"\n",

This means the baby develops inside an egg, and the mother lays it on land or in water. The baby then hatches from the egg when it\\'s ready.\\n\\n**Some animals**, like insects, don\\'t give birth or lay eggs. Instead, they go through a process called metamorphosis, where they change from one form to another. \\n\\nIt\\'s amazing how different animals have different ways of bringing new life into the world! \\n\"\n",
